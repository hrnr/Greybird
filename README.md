#Greybird

This is my modification of Greybird theme. It uses pale blue theme
color from original version of this theme.

Upstream homepage: http://shimmerproject.org/projects/greybird/

The Greybird desktop suite includes:
* Gtk+2 theme
* Gtk+3 theme
* Xfwm4 themes (normal and compact)
* xfce-notifyd theme (dark and bright)
* Emerald theme
* Metacity theme
* Mutter theme
* Unity support

##Dependencies
Dependencies for Gtk+2 support:
* gtk2-engines-murrine

The Gtk+3 theme uses the builtin engine and consequently has no dependencies.
